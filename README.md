The files include the codes for pre-trained models as well as the CNN model that was made by us:
- `CNN.py`: The CNN model.
- `vgg19.py`: The VGG 19 model.
- `vgg19_EAI.py`: The VGG 19 model, XAI for demonstrating Pneumonia detection feature extraction.
- `pneumonia-resnet.ipynb`: The ResNet models, 152 and 200.
All the saved models are attached as well
To run these codes, use google colab.
The dataset folder is also attached in here as:
- `chest_xray.`: The dataset for the project.
